   At the interface between developmental biology and computer science, I address together questions about embryonic morphogenesis, computer vision, data science and data visualisation.
   By developing novel and innovative computational algorithms I sought to quantify, model and better understand embryonic development at the single cell scale in whole organisms throughout development.
  
   More specifically, I want to understand how the different forms and functions of tissues, organs and organisms are obtained as a result of cell changes at the morphological and molecular level.
   % I will look at embryogenesis at the single cell scale by computationally building and combining statistical averages of the development across two modalities: fluorescence microscopy images and spatial omics.
   % To quantitatively understand how cells arrange in tissues, tissues in organs and organs in organisms, I will computationally build and combine statistical averages of embryonic development across two modalities: fluorescence microscopy images and spatial omics.
   I will do so across three main axes/question:
   \begin{enumerate}
       \item Morphological scale: \underline{How do cells organise in coherent structures?}
       \item Molecular scale: \underline{What genes control that organisation?}
       \item \emph{Morpholecular} scale: \underline{How do genes and cell organisation interplay?}
   \end{enumerate}
