	abstract = {We present a method to automatically identify and track nuclei in time-lapse microscopy recordings of entire developing embryos. The method combines deep learning and global optimization. On a mouse dataset, it reconstructs 75.8{\%} of cell lineages spanning 1 h, as compared to 31.8{\%} for the competing method. Our approach improves understanding of where and when cell fate decisions are made in developing embryos, tissues, and organs.},

	abstract = { Building mammalian embryos from self-organizing stem cells in culture would accelerate the investigation of morphogenetic and differentiation processes that shape the body plan. Veenvliet et al. report a method for generating embryonic trunk-like structures (TLSs) with a neural tube, somites, and gut by embedding mouse embryonic stem cell aggregates in an extracellular matrix surrogate. Live imaging and comparative single-cell transcriptomics indicate that TLS formation is analogous to mouse development. TLSs therefore provide a scalable, tractable, and accessible high-throughput platform for decoding mammalian embryogenesis at a high level of resolution. Science, this issue p. eaba4937 A platform for investigating post-implantation embryogenesis in a dish incorporates precursors of spinal cord, bone, and muscle. Post-implantation embryogenesis is a highly dynamic process comprising multiple lineage decisions and morphogenetic changes that are inaccessible to deep analysis in vivo. We found that pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) form aggregates that upon embedding in an extracellular matrix compound induce the formation of highly organized ``trunk-like structures'' (TLSs) comprising the neural tube and somites. Comparative single-cell RNA sequencing analysis confirmed that this process is highly analogous to mouse development and follows the same stepwise gene-regulatory program. Tbx6 knockout TLSs developed additional neural tubes mirroring the embryonic mutant phenotype, and chemical modulation could induce excess somite formation. TLSs thus reveal an advanced level of self-organization and provide a powerful platform for investigating post-implantation embryogenesis in a dish. },

	abstract = {We developed a theoretical framework to prove the existence and quantify the Waddington landscape as well as chreode-biological paths for development and differentiation. The cells can have states with the higher probability ones giving the different cell types. Different cell types correspond to different basins of attractions of the probability landscape. We study how the cells develop from undifferentiated cells to differentiated cells from landscape perspectives. We quantified the Waddington landscape through construction of underlying probability landscape for cell development. We show the developmental process proceeds as moving from undifferentiated to the differentiated basins of attractions. The barrier height of the basins of attractions correlates with the escape time that determines the stability of cell types. We show that the developmental process can be quantitatively described and uncovered by the biological paths on the quantified Waddington landscape from undifferentiated to the differentiated cells. We found the dynamics of the developmental process is controlled by a combination of the gradient and curl force on the landscape. The biological paths often do not follow the steepest descent path on the landscape. The landscape framework also quantifies the possibility of reverse differentiation process such as cell reprogramming from differentiated cells back to the original stem cell. We show that the biological path of reverse differentiation is irreversible and different from the one for differentiation process. We found that the developmental process described by the underlying landscape and the associated biological paths is relatively stable and robust against the influences of environmental perturbations.},

The hourglass model builds on classic observations by Karl Ernst von Baer, later popularized by Ernst Haeckel ---Charles Darwin's champion in Germany. But is this 'phylotypic stage' real? Two groups use contrasting methodology to test ---and provide support for ---the model. Genes expressed during the phylotypic stage are both evolutionarily older and more conserved across the genus than those expressed at other stages.},

@article{Oster:1988aa,
	abstract = {The notion of a "developmental constraint" has become a catchphrase for a collection of poorly defined notions about how ontogeny affects phylogeny. In this paper, we shall attempt to define this idea more precisely by examining the vertebrate limb from three viewpoints. First, theoretical models of morphogenesis suggest several generalizations about how limb geometry is laid down during development. Comparative studies and experimental manipulations of developing limbs independently confirm these generalizations, which amount to a set of "construction rules" for determining how the major features of limb architecture are established in ontogeny. Armed with these rules, we can inquire how limb morphology can be varied during evolution and suggest a more precise operational definition of "developmental constraints" on morphological evolution.},

@article{Alberch:1989aa,
	abstract = {One of the most outstanding properties of naturaldiversity is its discreteness and order. Species can be identified and classified because of this property. There are two philosophical approaches to interpret the orderliness of natural systems. These two conceptual positions, wich I refer to as ``externalist'' and ``internalist'', prescribe drastically distinct methodological approaches. Classical neo-Darwinism falls within the ``externalist'' tradition, with its emphasis in natural selection as the main ordering agent in evolution, this approach basically argues that the properties of the physical ant biotic environment determine the selective pressures and consequently dictate which form will be selected over others. Therefore, the discreteness and order of natural diversity is a direct reflection of the topography of the adaptative landscape. The internalist approach attributes some of the order observed in nature as the result of the emergent properties of generative rules. I explore the latter methodological approach introducing data from teratological systems to illustrate how order exists, and classification is possible, in clearly non-functional systems. Subsequently I examine the properties of pattern generating systems and use limb development and evolution as a case study to illustrate how we can carry out an evolutionary study from an internalist perspective. I also discuss the structure, organization and properties of pattern-generating systems and the role of genes in morphological evolution. I argue that is not possible to construct a genetic theory of morphological evolution since genes and development cannot be dissociated as different levels of interaction. I conclude with a synthetic view of morphological evolution and propose that it is as interesting and illuminating to focus on invariance as on diversity. Similarly, monsters are a good system to study the internal properties of generative rules. They represent forms which lack adaptative function while preserving structural order. An analysis of monsters, is a study of ``pure form'' in the classical Naturphilosophie sense. There is an internal logic to the genesis and transformation and in that logic we may learn about the constraints on the normal.
R{\'e}sum{\'e}
Une des propri{\'e}t{\'e}s les plus {\'e}videntes de la diversit{\'e}naturelle est sa discontinuit{\'e} et son organisation. Les esp{\`e}ces peuvent {\^e}tre identifi{\'e}es et class{\'e}es {\`a} cause de cette propri{\'e}t{\'e}. Philosophiquement, il existe deux approches qui permettent d'interpr{\'e}ter cette organisation des syst{\`e}mes naturels. Ces deux conceptions, que je qualifie d' ``externaliste'' et d' ``internaliste'' imposent des m{\'e}thodes d'approche tr{\`e}s diff{\'e}rentes. Avec la s{\'e}lection naturelle comme principal agent d'organisation de l'{\'e}volution, le n{\'e}o-Darwinisme classique se rapporte {\`a} la tradition externaliste. Cette approche admet que les param{\`e}tres physiques et biotiques de l'environnement d{\'e}terminent seuls la pression de s{\'e}lection et, en cons{\'e}quence, d{\'e}terminent quelle forme sera s{\'e}lectionn{\'e}e. Ainsi, la discontinuit{\'e} et l'ordre de la diversit{\'e} naturelle sont le reflet direct de la topographie du paysage adaptatif. L'approche internaliste attribue une part de l'ordre naturel {\`a} l'{\'e}mergence de propri{\'e}t{\'e}s intrins{\`e}ques au mat{\'e}riel vivant. J'examine cette derni{\`e}re approche {\`a} partir de donn{\'e}es tir{\'e}es de syst{\`e}mes t{\'e}ratologiques pour illustrer comment cet ordre se manifeste, et quelle classification est possible dans des syst{\`e}mes clairement non fonctionnels. Ensuite, j'examine les propri{\'e}t{\'e}s de syst{\`e}mes g{\'e}n{\'e}rateurs et j'utilise le d{\'e}veloppement et l'{\'e}volution des membres pour illustrer comment on peut mener une {\'e}tude {\'e}volutive dans une perspective internaliste. Je discute aussi la structure, l'organisation et les propri{\'e}t{\'e}s des syst{\`e}mes g{\'e}n{\'e}rateurs ainsi que le r{\^o}le des g{\`e}nes dans l'{\'e}volution morphologique. J'admets qu'il n'est pas possible de construire une th{\'e}orie g{\'e}n{\'e}tique de l'{\'e}volution morphologique puisque g{\`e}nes et d{\'e}veloppement ne peuvent {\^e}tre dissoci{\'e}s en tant que niveaux d'interaction diff{\'e}rents. Je termine par une vision synth{\'e}tique de l'{\'e}volution morphologique et sugg{\`e}re qu'il est tout aussi fructueux de s'int{\'e}resser {\`a} l'invariance qu'{\`a} la diversit{\'e}. Les monstres sont un bon mod{\`e}le pour comprendre les propri{\'e}t{\'e}s internes des syst{\`e}mes g{\'e}n{\'e}rateurs. Ils correspondent {\`a} des formes qui n'ont pas de fonction adaptative, mais qui conservent l'ordre structural. Une analyse des monstruosit{\'e}s est une {\'e}tude de la ``forme pure'' au sens classique de Naturphilosophie. Il existe une logique dans la gen{\`e}se et la transformation des monstruosit{\'e}s qui nous renseigne sur les contraintes qui existent dans les cas normaux.},

	abstract = {A long-standing goal of biology is to map the behavior of all cells during vertebrate embryogenesis. We developed digital scanned laser light sheet fluorescence microscopy and recorded nuclei localization and movement in entire wild-type and mutant zebrafish embryos over the first 24 hours of development. Multiview in vivo imaging at 1.5 billion voxels per minute provides ``digital embryos,'' that is, comprehensive databases of cell positions, divisions, and migratory tracks. Our analysis of global cell division patterns reveals a maternally defined initial morphodynamic symmetry break, which identifies the embryonic body axis. We further derive a model of germ layer formation and show that the mesendoderm forms from one-third of the embryo's cells in a single event. Our digital embryos, with 55 million nucleus entries, are provided as a resource.
Digitized tracking of each cell during the first 24 hours of zebrafish development reveals how the body axis and germ layer are formed and provides a community resource.

We present an open-source computational framework for the segmentation and tracking of cell nuclei with high accuracy and speed. We demonstrate its (i) generality by reconstructing cell lineages in four-dimensional, terabyte-sized image data sets of fruit fly, zebrafish and mouse embryos acquired with three types of fluorescence microscopes, (ii) scalability by analyzing advanced stages of development with up to 20,000 cells per time point at 26,000 cells min−1 on a single computer workstation and (iii) ease of use by adjusting only two parameters across all data sets and providing visualization and editing tools for efficient data curation. Our approach achieves on average 97.0\% linkage accuracy across all species and imaging modalities. Using our system, we performed the first cell lineage reconstruction of early Drosophila melanogaster nervous system development, revealing neuroblast dynamics throughout an entire embryo.},

@article{Bai:2019aa,
	abstract = {The complementary beam subtraction (CBS) method can reduce the out-of-focus background and improve the axial resolution in light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) via double scanning a Bessel and the complementary beams. With the assistance of a compressed blind deconvolution and denoising (CBDD) algorithm, the noise and blurring incurred during CBS imaging can be further removed. However, this approach requires double scanning and large computational cost. Here, we propose a deep learning-based method for LSFM, which can reconstruct high-quality images directly from the conventional Bessel beam (BB) light-sheet via a single scan. The image quality achievable with this CBS-Deep method is competitive with or better than the CBS-CBDD method, while the speed of image reconstruction is about 100 times faster. Accordingly, the proposed method can significantly improve the practicality of the CBS-CBDD system by reducing both scanning behavior and reconstruction time. The results show that this cost-effective and convenient method enables high-quality LSFM techniques to be developed and applied.},

	abstract = {We present the Real-time Accurate Cell-shape Extractor (RACE), a high-throughput image analysis framework for automated three-dimensional cell segmentation in large-scale images. RACE is 55--330 times faster and 2--5 times more accurate than state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the generality of RACE by extracting cell-shape information from entire Drosophila, zebrafish, and mouse embryos imaged with confocal and light-sheet microscopes. Using RACE, we automatically reconstructed cellular-resolution tissue anisotropy maps across developing Drosophila embryos and quantified differences in cell-shape dynamics in wild-type and mutant embryos. We furthermore integrated RACE with our framework for automated cell lineaging and performed joint segmentation and cell tracking in entire Drosophila embryos. RACE processed these terabyte-sized datasets on a single computer within 1.4 days. RACE is easy to use, as it requires adjustment of only three parameters, takes full advantage of state-of-the-art multi-core processors and graphics cards, and is available as open-source software for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.},

	abstract = {The invariant cell lineage and cell fate of Caenorhabditis elegans provide a unique opportunity to decode the molecular mechanisms of animal development. To exploit this opportunity, we have developed a system for automated cell lineage tracing during C. elegans embryogenesis, based on 3D, time-lapse imaging and automated image analysis. Using ubiquitously expressed histone--GFP fusion protein to label cells/nuclei and a confocal microscope, the imaging protocol captures embryogenesis at high spatial (31 planes at 1 μm apart) and temporal (every minute) resolution without apparent effects on development. A set of image analysis algorithms then automatically recognizes cells at each time point, tracks cell movements, divisions and deaths over time and assigns cell identities based on the canonical naming scheme. Starting from the four-cell stage (or earlier), our software, named starrynite, can trace the lineage up to the 350-cell stage in 25 min on a desktop computer. The few errors of automated lineaging can then be corrected in a few hours with a graphic interface that allows easy navigation of the images and the reported lineage tree. The system can be used to characterize lineage phenotypes of genes and/or extended to determine gene expression patterns in a living embryo at the single-cell level. We envision that this automation will make it practical to systematically decipher the developmental genes and pathways encoded in the genome of C. elegans.},

	abstract = {The quantification of cell shape, cell migration, and cell rearrangements is important for addressing classical questions in developmental biology such as patterning and tissue morphogenesis. Time-lapse microscopic imaging of transgenic embryos expressing fluorescent reporters is the method of choice for tracking morphogenetic changes and establishing cell lineages and fate maps in vivo. However, the manual steps involved in curating thousands of putative cell segmentations have been a major bottleneck in the application of these technologies especially for cell membranes. Segmentation of cell membranes while more difficult than nuclear segmentation is necessary for quantifying the relations between changes in cell morphology and morphogenesis. We present a novel and fully automated method to first reconstruct membrane signals and then segment out cells from 3D membrane images even in dense tissues. The approach has three stages: 1) detection of local membrane planes, 2) voting to fill structural gaps, and 3) region segmentation. We demonstrate the superior performance of the algorithms quantitatively on time-lapse confocal and two-photon images of zebrafish neuroectoderm and paraxial mesoderm by comparing its results with those derived from human inspection. We also compared with synthetic microscopic images generated by simulating the process of imaging with fluorescent reporters under varying conditions of noise. Both the over-segmentation and under-segmentation percentages of our method are around 5\%. The volume overlap of individual cells, compared to expert manual segmentation, is consistently over 84\%. By using our software (ACME) to study somite formation, we were able to segment touching cells with high accuracy and reliably quantify changes in morphogenetic parameters such as cell shape and size, and the arrangement of epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Our software has been developed and tested on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms and is available publicly under an open source BSD license (https://github.com/krm15/ACME).},

The hourglass model of embryonic evolution predicts an hourglass-like divergence during animal embryogenesis -- with embryos being more divergent at the earliest and latest stages but conserved during a mid-embryonic (phylotypic) period that serves as a source of the basic body plan for animals within a phylum. Morphological observations have suggested hourglass-like divergence in various vertebrate and invertebrate groups, and recent molecular data support this model. However, further investigation is required to determine whether the phylotypic period represents a basic body plan for each animal phylum, and whether this principle might apply at higher taxonomic levels. Here, we discuss the relationship between the basic body plan and the phylotypic stage, and address the possible mechanisms that underlie hourglass-like divergence.},

@article{Duboule:1994aa,
	abstract = {Skip to Next Section
Vertebrate Hox genes are essential for the proper organization of the body plan during development. Inactivation of these genes usually leads to important alterations, or transformations, in the identities of the affected developing structures. Hox genes are activated in a progressive temporal sequence which is colinear with the position of these genes on their respective complexes, so that `anterior' genes are activated earlier than `posterior' ones (temporal colinearity). Here, an hypothesis is considered in which the correct timing of activation of this gene family is necessary in order to properly establish the various expression domains. Slight modifications in the respective times of gene activation (heterochronies) may shift expression domains along the rostrocaudal axis and thus induce concurrent changes in morphologies. It is further argued that temporal colinearity only occurs in cells with high mitotic rates, which results in a strong linkage between patterning and growth control and makes the patterning process unidirectional, from anterior, proximal and early, to posterior, distal and late, a model referred to as the `Einbahnstrasse'. While the nature of the mechanism(s) behind temporal and spatial colinearities is unknown, it is proposed that such a mechanism relies on meta-cis interactions, that is it may necessitate gene contiguity. Such a mechanism would be based on DNA-specific, rather than gene-specific, features such as chromatin configurations or DNA replication. The existence of such a meta-cis mechanism would explain the extraordinary conservation of this genetic system during evolution as its basic properties would be linked to that of the genetic material itself. Consequently, it is hypothesized that, in vertebrates, the resistance of this mechanism to evolutionary variations may be the reason for the existence of a short developmental window of morphological invariance (the phylotypic progression).},

@article{Waddington:1942aa,
	abstract = {THE battle, which raged for so long between the theories of evolution supported by geneticists on one hand and by naturalists on the other, has in recent years gone strongly in favour of the former. Few biologists now doubt that genetical investigation has revealed at any rate the most important categories of hereditary variation ; and the classical 'naturalist' theory-the inheritance of acquired characters-has been very generally relegated to the background because, in the forms in which it has been put forward, it has required a type of hereditary variation for the existence of which there was no adequate evidence. The long popularity of the theory was based, not on any positive evidence for it, but on its usefulness in accounting for some of the most striking of the results of evolution. Naturalists cannot fail to be continually and deeply impressed by the adaptation of an organism to its surroundings and of the parts of the organism to each other. These adaptive characters are inherited and some explanation of this must be provided. If we are deprived of the hypothesis of the inheritance of the effects of use and disuse, we seem thrown back on an exclusive reliance on the natural selection of merely chance mutations. It is doubtful, however, whether even the most statistically minded geneticists are entirely satisfied that nothing more is involved than the sorting out of random mutations by the natural selective filter. It is the purpose of this short communication to suggest that recent views on the nature of the developmental process make it easier to understand how the genotypes of evolving organisms can respond to the environment in a more co-ordinated fashion.},

Having validated the formalism on computer simulations, we quantified separately all morphogenetic events in the Drosophila dorsal thorax and wing pupal epithelia to obtain comprehensive statistical maps linking cell and tissue scale dynamics. While globally cell shape changes, rearrangements and divisions all significantly participate in tissue morphogenesis, locally, their relative participations display major variations in space and time. By blocking division we analyzed the impact of division on rearrangements, cell shape changes and tissue morphogenesis. Finally, by combining the formalism with mechanical stress measurement, we evidenced unexpected interplays between patterns of tissue elongation, cell division and stress. Our formalism provides a novel and rigorous approach to uncover mechanisms governing tissue development.},

The DM is model and parameter-free, frame-invariant, robust to measurement errors, and can be computed from unfiltered cell velocity data. It reveals the spatial attractors and repellers of the embryo, objects that cannot be identified by simple trajectory inspection or Eulerian methods that are local and typically frame-dependent. Computing the DM underlying primitive streak formation in chicken embryo and early gastrulation in the whole fly embryo, we find that the DM captures the early footprint of known morphogenetic features, and reveals new ones, providing a geometric framework to analyze tissue organization.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {.Discrete rearranging patterns include cellular patterns, for instance liquid foams, biological tissues, grains in polycrystals; assemblies of particles such as beads, granular materials, colloids, molecules, atoms; and interconnected networks. Such a pattern can be described as a list of links between neighbouring sites. Performing statistics on the links between neighbouring sites yields average quantities (hereafter ``tools'') as the result of direct measurements on images. These descriptive tools are flexible and suitable for various problems where quantitative measurements are required, whether in two or in three dimensions. Here, we present a coherent set of robust tools, in three steps. First, we revisit the definitions of three existing tools based on the texture matrix. Second, thanks to their more general definition, we embed these three tools in a self-consistent formalism, which includes three additional ones. Third, we show that the six tools together provide a direct correspondence between a small scale, where they quantify the discrete pattern's local distortion and rearrangements, and a large scale, where they help describe a material as a continuous medium. This enables to formulate elastic, plastic, fluid behaviours in a common, self-consistent modelling using continuous mechanics. Experiments, simulations and models can be expressed in the same language and directly compared. As an example, a companion paper (P. Marmottant, C. Raufaste, and F.

Quantitative tests of this idea, however, require a theoretical framework capable of exposing the rules and precision of cell specification over developmental time. We use the gap gene network in the early fly embryo as an example to show how expression levels of the four gap genes can be jointly decoded into an optimal specification of position with 1\% accuracy. The decoder correctly predicts, with no free parameters, the dynamics of pair-rule expression patterns at different developmental time points and in various mutant backgrounds. Precise cellular identities are thus available at the earliest stages of development, contrasting the prevailing view of positional information being slowly refined across successive layers of the patterning network. Our results suggest that developmental enhancers closely approximate a mathematically optimal decoding strategy.},

	abstract = {To fully understand animal transcription networks, it is essential to accurately measure the spatial and temporal expression patterns of transcription factors and their targets. We describe a registration technique that takes image-based data from hundreds of Drosophila blastoderm embryos, each costained for a reference gene and one of a set of genes of interest, and builds a model VirtualEmbryo. This model captures in a common framework the average expression patterns for many genes in spite of significant variation in morphology and expression between individual embryos. We establish the method's accuracy by showing that relationships between a pair of genes' expression inferred from the model are nearly identical to those measured in embryos costained for the pair. We present a VirtualEmbryo containing data for 95 genes at six time cohorts. We show that known gene-regulatory interactions can be automatically recovered from this data set and predict hundreds of new interactions.},

The tunicates, or urochordates, constitute a large group of marine animals whose recent common ancestry with vertebrates is reflected in the tadpole-like larvae of most tunicates. Their diversity and key phylogenetic position are enhanced, from a research viewpoint, by anatomically simple and transparent embryos, compact rapidly evolving genomes, and the availability of powerful experimental and computational tools with which to study these organisms. Tunicates are thus a powerful system for exploring chordate evolution and how extreme variation in genome sequence and gene regulatory network architecture is compatible with the preservation of an ancestral chordate body plan.},

	abstract = {Ascidians present a striking dichotomy between conserved phenotypes and divergent genomes: embryonic cell lineages and gene expression patterns are conserved between distantly related species. Much research has focused on Ciona or Halocynthia spp. but development in other ascidians remains poorly characterized. In this study, we surveyed the multipotent myogenic B7.5 lineage in Molgula spp. Comparisons to the homologous lineage in Ciona revealed identical cell division and fate specification events that result in segregation of larval, cardiac, and pharyngeal muscle progenitors. Moreover, the expression patterns of key regulators are conserved, but cross-species transgenic assays uncovered incompatibility, or 'unintelligibility', of orthologous cis-regulatory sequences between Molgula and Ciona. These sequences drive identical expression patterns that are not recapitulated in cross-species assays. We show that this unintelligibility is likely due to changes in both cis- and trans-acting elements, hinting at widespread and frequent turnover of regulatory mechanisms underlying otherwise conserved aspects of ascidian embryogenesis.},

When looking at populations of cells, features such as cell heterogeneity and localization are masked. However, single-cell sequencing reveals cellular heterogeneity and rare cell types. At the onset of gastrulation, the fly embryo consists of about 6000 cells with distinct gene expression profiles. Karaiskos et al. developed an algorithm to generate an interactive three-dimensional (3D) ``virtual embryo,'' with the expression of more than 8000 genes per cell measured for most cells (see the Perspective by Stadler and Eisen). The virtual embryo offers insights into developmental mechanisms---from local expression of regulators such as transcription factors and long noncoding RNAs to spatial modulation of signaling pathways.
Science, this issue p. 194; see also p. 172
By the onset of morphogenesis, Drosophila embryos consist of about 6000 cells that express distinct gene combinations. Here, we used single-cell sequencing of precisely staged embryos and devised DistMap, a computational mapping strategy to reconstruct the embryo and to predict spatial gene expression approaching single-cell resolution. We produced a virtual embryo with about 8000 expressed genes per cell. Our interactive Drosophila Virtual Expression eXplorer (DVEX) database generates three-dimensional virtual in situ hybridizations and computes gene expression gradients. We used DVEX to uncover patterned expression of transcription factors and long noncoding RNAs, as well as signaling pathway components. Spatial regulation of Hippo signaling during early embryogenesis suggests a mechanism for establishing asynchronous cell proliferation. Our approach is suitable to generate transcriptomic blueprints for other complex tissues.
Single-cell sequencing and an interactive database enable the generation of a 3D virtual fly embryo and a gene expression blueprint.

Here, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to {\textgreater}92,000 cells from zebrafish embryos during the first day of development. Using a graph-based approach, we mapped a cell state landscape that describes axis patterning, germ layer formation, and organogenesis. We tested how clonally related cells traverse this landscape by developing a transposon-based barcoding approach (``TracerSeq'') for reconstructing single-cell lineage histories. Clonally related cells were often restricted by the state landscape, including a case in which two independent lineages converge on similar fates. Cell fates remained restricted to this landscape in chordin-deficient embryos. We provide web-based resources for further analysis of the single-cell data.},

The past decade has seen an explosion in the field of in vitro disease modelling, in particular the development of organoids. These self-organizing tissues derived from stem cells provide a unique system to examine mechanisms ranging from organ development to homeostasis and disease. Because organoids develop according to intrinsic developmental programmes, the resultant tissue morphology recapitulates organ architecture with remarkable fidelity. Furthermore, the fact that these tissues can be derived from human progenitors allows for the study of uniquely human processes and disorders. This article and accompanying poster highlight the currently available methods, particularly those aimed at modelling human biology, and provide an overview of their capabilities and limitations. We also speculate on possible future technological advances that have the potential for great strides in both disease modelling and future regenerative strategies.},

Here, we address the drivers of this reproducibility. We used light-sheet imaging and automated cell segmentation and tracking procedures to systematically quantify the behavior of individual cells every 2 minutes during Phallusia mammillata embryogenesis. Interindividual reproducibility was observed down to the area of individual cell contacts. We found tight links between the reproducibility of embryonic geometries and asymmetric cell divisions, controlled by differential sister cell inductions. We combined modeling and experimental manipulations to show that the area of contact between signaling and responding cells is a key determinant of cell communication. Our work establishes the geometric control of embryonic inductions as an alternative to classical morphogen gradients and suggests that the range of cell signaling sets the scale at which embryonic reproducibility is observed.},

	abstract = {Coordinated cell migration is a hallmark of tissue morphogenesis during development and emerges from the combination of local cell behaviors and distributed chemo-mechanical interactions integrated across many spatial and temporal scales. A challenge in the field is to predict developmental outcomes of tissue morphogenesis using cellular trajectories. We provide a rigorous kinematic framework to analyze cell motion and identify robust multicellular attractors and repellers in space and time. Our results yield a scheme for comparing different morphogenetic phenotypes and help bridge the gap between bottom-up and top-down modeling approaches to morphogenesis.Morphogenetic flows in developmental biology are characterized by the coordinated motion of thousands of cells that organize into tissues, naturally raising the question of how this collective organization arises. Using only the kinematics of tissue deformation, which naturally integrates local and global mechanisms along cell paths, we identify the dynamic morphoskeletons behind morphogenesis, i.e., the evolving centerpieces of multicellular trajectory patterns. These features are model- and parameter-free, frame-invariant, and robust to measurement errors and can be computed from unfiltered cell-velocity data. We reveal the spatial attractors and repellers of the embryo by quantifying its Lagrangian deformation, information that is inaccessible to simple trajectory inspection or Eulerian methods that are local and typically frame-dependent. Computing these dynamic morphoskeletons in wild-type and mutant chick and fly embryos, we find that they capture the early footprint of known morphogenetic features, reveal new ones, and quantitatively distinguish between different phenotypes.},

Here we describe Splotch, a novel computational framework for the analysis of spatially resolved transcriptomics data. Splotch aligns transcriptomics data from multiple tissue sections and timepoints to generate improved posterior estimates of gene expression. We demonstrate alignment of a large corpus of single-cell RNA-seq data into an automatically generated spatial-temporal coordinate and study optimal design for spatial transcriptomics experiments.},

In this chapter we will first present the basics of cell tracking. Second, we will describe how to choose the method that is best suited for different application scopes. Ultimately, we will describe in more detail different types of methods, their strengths, and limitations.}
